# SoftKit
SoftKit is a toolkit for developing flexible, scalable, desktop and web applications in OverScript, C# programming languages. SDK gathers a lot of tools: from API for rendering 2D graphics to complex animation system and interactive variable hierarchy.

At this stage the project is under active development, but already now you can find some materials on the official SoftKit website: https://softkit.org
